Here‚Äôs a summarized list of key points about the `ngDoCheck()` lifecycle hook in Angular:

### üîÅ **ngDoCheck() Lifecycle Hook ‚Äì Summary Points**

1. **Position in Lifecycle**

   * Called **after `ngOnChanges()`** and **`ngOnInit()`**.
   * It‚Äôs the **third** lifecycle hook in the Angular component lifecycle.

2. **When It Is Called**

   * Called **on every change detection cycle**, even if no actual data has changed.
   * Will run on:

     * User events like `click`, `focus`, etc.
     * Timer events or manual triggering of change detection.

3. **Purpose & Use Cases**

   * Used to implement **custom change detection logic**.
   * Useful when Angular **fails to detect changes** in `@Input()` properties.
   * Can be used to **run logic repeatedly** whenever Angular runs change detection.

4. **Difference from `ngOnChanges()`**

   * `ngOnChanges()` runs **only when `@Input` value actually changes**.
   * `ngDoCheck()` runs **even if value doesn‚Äôt change**, just due to change detection.

5. **Example Behavior**

   * Clicking a button (even if it does nothing) triggers `ngDoCheck()`.
   * Focusing an input field also triggers `ngDoCheck()` due to the event.

6. **Implementation Notes**

   * Requires importing and implementing the `DoCheck` interface.
   * Used with the `@Input()` properties when default change detection is insufficient.

7. **Debugging Tip**

   * You can place `console.log()` inside `ngDoCheck()` to track its calls and observe change detection triggers.
