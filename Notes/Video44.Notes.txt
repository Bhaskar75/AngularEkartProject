Here are **all the important points** from the lecture on Angularâ€™s `ngAfterViewInit` lifecycle hook:

---

ðŸ”¹ **What is `ngAfterViewInit`?**

* A lifecycle hook that is called **after the componentâ€™s view (HTML)** and **all its child componentsâ€™ views** are fully initialized.
* It is part of Angular's **View Lifecycle**.

---

ðŸ”¹ **When is it Called?**

* Called **after `ngAfterContentChecked`**.
* Executes **only once**: during the **first change detection cycle** when the component is created.
* **Not called** again even if the view changes later.

---

ðŸ”¹ **Behavior with Child Components**

* `ngAfterViewInit` of a parent component is **called only after all lifecycle hooks of its child components are executed**.
* For example:

  * Parent: AppComponent
  * Child: DemoComponent
  * `ngAfterViewInit` of **DemoComponent** is called **before** `ngAfterViewInit` of **AppComponent**.

---

ðŸ”¹ **ViewChild/ViewChildren Initialization**

* Properties decorated with `@ViewChild` or `@ViewChildren` are:

  * **Initialized just before** `ngAfterViewInit` is called.
  * **Not initialized** before `ngAfterContentChecked`.

âœ… Example:

```ts
@ViewChild('temp') tempPara: ElementRef;
```

* `tempPara` will be:

  * **`undefined`** in `ngAfterContentChecked`.
  * **Defined** in `ngAfterViewInit`.

---

ðŸ”¹ **Practical Flow Observed in Console**

Console logs may look like:

```
DemoComponent: ngOnInit
DemoComponent: ngDoCheck
DemoComponent: ngAfterContentInit
DemoComponent: ngAfterContentChecked
DemoComponent: ngAfterViewInit
AppComponent: ngAfterViewInit
```

ðŸ”¹ **Summary Table of Lifecycle Order**

| Lifecycle Hook          | Description                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ngAfterContentChecked` | Called after content (from `<ng-content>`) is checked       |
| `ngAfterViewInit`       | Called after componentâ€™s own view and child views are ready |

---

ðŸ”¹ **Directive Limitation**

* **Only available for components**.
* **Cannot be used inside directives**.

---

ðŸ”¹ **Use Cases**

* Perform operations on DOM elements after the view is fully loaded.
* Safely use references obtained via `@ViewChild`.
* Interact with child componentsâ€™ views only after they're initialized.
