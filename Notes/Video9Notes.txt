Certainly! Here's the summary in a numbered format:

1. **Setting Up Styling**: Angular provides two properties in the `@Component` decorator for styling a view template:
   - `styles`: Used to directly write CSS within the component.
   - `styleUrls`: Used to reference external CSS files.

2. **Using `styles` Property**:
   - This property takes an array of strings where each string represents CSS styles.
   - Example: To style an anchor and a button, write CSS directly inside the array.
   - **Limitations of `styles`**:
     1. Mixing CSS with TypeScript makes the code less maintainable.
     2. CSS errors (e.g., syntax issues) are not caught during compilation, only at runtime.
     3. Large amounts of CSS make the array long and difficult to manage.

3. **Using `styleUrls` Property**:
   - To keep CSS separate from TypeScript, use `styleUrls` and reference a separate CSS file.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Create a new CSS file, such as `header.component.css`, in the component’s folder.
     2. Reference this file in the `styleUrls` array of the component’s decorator.
   - **Advantages**:
     1. Keeps CSS separate, improving code readability and maintainability.
     2. CSS files can be reused across components if needed.

4. **Component-Specific Styles**:
   - Styles defined in `styleUrls` only apply to that component’s view template.
   - Example: Styles set in `app.component.css` won’t affect elements within `header.component.html` (a child component), unlike in React.

5. **Summary**:
   - Use `styles` for small, inline styling or testing.
   - Use `styleUrls` for more complex and maintainable CSS.
   - Styles in `styleUrls` apply only to the component they are specified for, promoting style encapsulation. 

This concludes the lecture on styling Angular view templates using `styles` and `styleUrls`.
