Here's a summarized version of the lecture on **`ngAfterContentInit()` lifecycle hook in Angular**:

### 📌 **ngAfterContentInit() Lifecycle Hook – Summary**

🔁 **When is it Called?**

* Called **after `ngDoCheck()`** and **once** the **projected content** (via `<ng-content>`) has been fully initialized.
* Runs **only once** during the **first change detection cycle**, similar to `ngOnInit()`.

📦 **What Triggers It?**

* Triggered when Angular has **finished initializing the content** projected into a component using `<ng-content>`.
* Even if **no content is projected**, it **still gets called**.

🧩 **Use Case: Content Projection**

* Suppose a **child component** uses `<ng-content>` in its template.
* When a **parent component** projects content (like `<p #temp>Projected Content</p>`), `ngAfterContentInit()` is triggered **after** that content is fully initialized and injected.

🧪 **Example Behavior**

1. If content is projected → Hook called after projected elements are ready.
2. If content is **not** projected → Still gets called once.
3. If `<ng-content>` is removed → Still gets called (but `ContentChild` will be `undefined`).

🧵 **Relation with @ContentChild/@ContentChildren**

* Angular **resolves `@ContentChild` and `@ContentChildren` just before** this hook.
* So, accessing them in:

  * `ngOnInit()` or `ngDoCheck()` → ❌ may return `undefined`.
  * `ngAfterContentInit()` → ✅ fully available and usable.

🧪 **Example: Logging ContentChild**

```ts
@ContentChild('temp', { static: false }) paraContent: ElementRef;

ngAfterContentInit() {
  console.log(this.paraContent.nativeElement.innerHTML); // ✅ Safe here
}

ngDoCheck() {
  console.log(this.paraContent); // ❌ Might be undefined
}
```

🧠 **Key Insight**

* Lifecycle hooks ending in `Init` (like `ngOnInit`, `ngAfterContentInit`) run **only once** when the component is created.
