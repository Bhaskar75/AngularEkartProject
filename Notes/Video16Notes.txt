Here’s a breakdown of the main points covered in this lecture:

1. **Introduction to Property Binding**:
   - Property binding is used for one-way data binding, similar to string interpolation.
   - It allows binding a DOM property to a value in the component class, useful for manipulating DOM elements dynamically.

2. **String Interpolation vs. Property Binding**:
   - String interpolation is ideal for displaying data within HTML.
   - Property binding is used for assigning dynamic values to HTML element attributes, allowing direct control over DOM properties.

3. **Example with Image Display**:
   - Instead of hardcoding the `src` attribute, an image file path is stored in a component property.
   - This path is then bound to the `src` attribute using property binding syntax with square brackets `[ ]`.

4. **Enabling/Disabling a Button Dynamically**:
   - A button is set to be disabled or enabled based on a product’s stock status.
   - The `disabled` attribute uses property binding with a condition, checking if the stock is greater than zero.

5. **Why Property Binding Over String Interpolation?**:
   - String interpolation cannot handle attributes like `disabled`, `hidden`, or `checked`.
   - Property binding is required for these attributes to work as expected.

6. **Example with Dynamic Input Value**:
   - A `value` attribute of an input element is bound to a `name` property from the component.
   - This demonstrates dynamic assignment using property binding.

7. **Alternative Syntax with `bind`**:
   - Instead of using square brackets `[ ]` for property binding, you can also use `bind-attribute-name`.
   - This syntax is valid but less common than using square brackets.

8. **Attribute Binding for Non-Property Attributes**:
   - Attributes such as `aria-hidden` or `data-*` attributes are not DOM properties and must use attribute binding.
   - Syntax: `attr.attribute-name` (e.g., `attr.aria-hidden`) to bind such attributes dynamically.

9. **Difference Between HTML Attributes and Properties**:
   - HTML attributes represent the initial value and do not change.
   - Properties reflect the current state and can change during runtime.

10. **Using `attr.` for Accessibility and Data Attributes**:
    - Accessibility attributes like `aria-label`, `aria-expanded`, and `data-*` attributes should use attribute binding.
    - This avoids errors that arise when binding these attributes directly as properties. 

11. **Summary and Conclusion**:
    - Property binding allows dynamic control of HTML attributes, while attribute binding is required for non-DOM properties.
    - Practice these concepts with examples and ask questions if needed.
